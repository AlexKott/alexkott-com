        <p>While there are so many new startups every week it seems that most of them are developing things to make developing things easier. This is a healthy sign of progress, but I ask myself why there are so few that use the web to make the real world a better and safer place for all of us.</p>`

        <p>When people from different backgrounds come together in a team they are more likely to teach and learn from each other and it often leads to more creative and well thought-out solutions.</p>`

        <p>The same thing applies when learning programming. Rather than just writing ahead, I like to take a step back and see how others are doing it. How are they organising their codebase? Why are they writing it that way? That way I found myself asking the same questions about my own codebase and improving its quality.</p>`

        <p>People who are trusted by their superiors will be much more likely to prove them right. When I feel trusted I want to honor that trust and am willing to put in extra effort to deliver great work.</p>`
